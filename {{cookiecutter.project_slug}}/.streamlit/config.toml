# 2024-01-20.
# ****************
# By default, Streamlit checks if the Python watchdog module is available
# and, if not, prints a warning asking for you to install it. The watchdog
# module is not required, but highly recommended. It improves Streamlit's
# ability to detect changes to files in your filesystem.
# If you'd like to turn off this warning, set this to True.
# Default: false
disableWatchdogWarning = false

# By default, Streamlit displays a warning when a user sets both a widget
# default value in the function defining the widget and a widget value via
# the widget's key in `st.session_state`.
# If you'd like to turn off this warning, set this to True.
# Default: false
disableWidgetStateDuplicationWarning = false

# If True, will show a warning when you run a Streamlit-enabled script
# via "python my_script.py".
# Default: true

# Default: 'info'
level = "info"

# String format for logging messages. If logger.datetimeFormat is set,
# logger messages will default to `%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d %(message)s`. See

# Default: true

# Streamlit displays app exceptions and associated tracebacks, and
# deprecation warnings, in the browser.
#
# If set to False, deprecation warnings and full exception messages
# will print to the console only. Exceptions will still display in the
# browser with a generic error message. For now, the exception type and
# traceback show in the browser also, but they will be removed in the
# future.
# Default: true

# Change the visibility of items in the toolbar, options menu,
# and settings dialog (top right of the app).
# Allowed values:

#                 Hide them otherwise.
# * "developer" : Show the developer options.
# * "viewer"    : Hide the developer options.
# * "minimal"   : Show only options set externally (e.g. through

# prevent Python crashing.
# Default: true

# Handle script rerun requests immediately, rather than waiting for script
# execution to reach a yield point. This makes Streamlit much more

# Default: true
fastReruns = true

# Raise an exception after adding unserializable data to Session State.

# Adjust how certain 'options' widgets like radio, selectbox, and
# multiselect coerce Enum members when the Enum class gets

# * "nameOnly"     : Enum classes can be coerced if their member names match.
